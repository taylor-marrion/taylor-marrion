> 👨‍💻 Cyber Capabilities Developer | 🎓 MSCS in Computer Science | 🔍 Reverse Engineering & Vulnerability Research Enthusiast | 🧠 ML for Cybersecurity

---

## 🎯 Objective

I am a U.S. Army National Guard Soldier and graduate student. I am currently on military orders supporting the 91st Cyber Brigade as a Cyber Capabilities Developer (CCD) and also taking the final course of my Masters of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) with a specialization in cyber operations. I have a deep interest in low-level security topics such as reverse engineering, vulnerability research, and threat hunting. Understanding manual workflows is essential, but I believe that automating or integrating them into Machine Learning and Large Language Models (ML / LLM) can set me apart from my peers. 

As I near my return to the civilian workforce and completion of my degree, I’m actively seeking roles. I would love to find roles where I can focus on reverse engineering and vulnerability research, or bring a unique skillset to your red team or threat hunters.

I bring a unique mix of:
- Deep experience in low-level C programming, architecture, and binary analysis
- A strong foundation in cybersecurity across both offensive and defensive domains
- Practical and academic exposure to machine learning applied to security-related problems

  ## 👨‍💻 Projects

- 🧱 **Generic Server-Client Architecture & Data Structure Libraries**  
  A modular C-based networking framework with reusable client-server code and custom implementations of data structures (BST, linked hash tables, queues).  
  *Purpose:* Demonstrates strong C programming and low-level architectural design. Serves as a foundation for future tooling.

- 🔍 **Machine Learning for Malware Detection**  
  A supervised classifier trained on Windows PE import features to distinguish malicious from benign executables.  
  *Focus:* Feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, and model comparison (KNN, MLR).

- 🔧 **FSM-Based Vulnerability Detection in Binary Executables**  
  A finite state machine-based static analyzer written in C for detecting uninitialized memory usage in compiled Juliet Test Suite binaries.  
  *Focus:* Manual static analysis, compiler-aware design, vulnerability pattern matching.

- 🔬 **LLM-Based Vulnerability Detection in Tokenized Assembly**  
  A transformer-based model trained to detect use of uninitialized variables from disassembled binaries.  
  *Focus:* Integrates NLP-style tokenization, FSM-derived supervision, and disassembly features.
